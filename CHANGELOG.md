# Changelog

## Unreleased

### The suites are written with `std/test`

`tests/harness.tw` is deleted. It was the copy of the same harness that loom,
spool and shuttle each carried, and `docs/needs.md` entry 15 said a `std/test`
was what would delete it. twill 1.11 shipped one, so every `*_test.tw` under
`tests/` imports `"std/test"` and calls the same four assertions by the same
names. The suites print the summary in the form `twill test` reads, and the
eight of them pass on twill 1.12.0.

The pin moved from 1.9.0 to 1.12.0 in `spool.toml` and in CI, and the README
says the floor is 1.11.0, because that is the release with the module.

## v0.1.0 (unreleased)

First cut of loom, the training framework for twill, written in twill.

It runs. `twill test tests` passes eight suites and
`twill run examples/classifier.tw` trains a model, both on twill 1.7.1. This
paragraph said the opposite until `mode systems` landed in twill 1.6. See
`docs/needs.md` for what the language still owes this library and `README.md`
for the status table, which names the test or the example behind every row.

Added:

- `fit`, `evaluate` and `predict`, with the step function passed in by the
  caller so the update rule stays visible and replaceable.
- Seven hook points and a total callback order, with the two ordering rules
  checked by `cb.validate` at the start of a run rather than left to review.
  Two schedules, or two early stoppers, are refused with a message.
- Early stopping, periodic and best-only checkpointing, four learning-rate
  schedules (step, exponential, cosine with warmup, plateau), metric logging in
  human and JSON form, and a plain-text progress callback.
- Metric accumulation weighted by batch row count, so a short final batch does
  not distort an epoch mean, plus a ratio counter for metrics that are not
  means over rows.
- Checkpoint and restore covering parameters, optimiser moments, adam's step
  count, the epoch, the global step, the learning rate and the callbacks'
  patience counters. A restore into a different seed, batch size, optimiser
  kind or row count is refused.
- One explicit seed, threaded through a per-epoch derivation, so a resumed run
  reproduces an uninterrupted one exactly at epoch granularity.
- Mixed precision as a policy the step function takes: bf16 or f16 forward
  passes over f32 master weights, with dynamic loss scaling for f16 that skips
  the step and halves the scale on a non-finite gradient and doubles it after
  a run of clean steps. bf16 is the documented recommendation; it needs no
  scaling at all.

Known gaps, deliberate for v0.1:

- No coloured output and no progress time estimate. twill's terminal layer is
  not reachable from an installed package; `docs/needs.md` entry 8.
- No mid-epoch checkpointing. The generator's position is not readable;
  `docs/needs.md` entry 6.
- No distributed training and no gradient accumulation.
- The loss-scale state is not checkpointed. A resumed f16 run re-converges its
  scale rather than restoring it; a resumed bf16 run has nothing to converge.
