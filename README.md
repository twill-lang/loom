## It runs

`loom` is written in twill, in `.tw` files, using `mode systems`. That subset
did not exist when this library was written, so for a long time none of the code
here executed and this section said so. twill 1.6 is the release that closed it:
the 8 test suites under `tests/` pass, the example trains a model, and CI runs
both against a released twill on every push rather than gating on the prose in
this file.

You need twill 1.11.0 or newer, because the suites are written with `std/test`,
which arrived in 1.11. Get one:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o twill https://github.com/twill-lang/twill/releases/download/v1.12.0/twill-v1.12.0-linux-amd64
chmod +x twill
```

The asset name is `twill-v1.12.0-<os>-<arch>`: `linux-amd64`, `linux-arm64`,
`darwin-amd64`, `darwin-arm64`, `windows-amd64.exe`.

The suite, from the repository root:

```
$ twill test tests
ok    tests/callback_test.tw
ok    tests/checkpoint_test.tw
ok    tests/data_test.tw
ok    tests/metrics_test.tw
ok    tests/precision_test.tw
ok    tests/report_test.tw
ok    tests/rng_test.tw
ok    tests/trainer_test.tw

8 file(s): 8 passed, 0 failed
```

And the example, which trains a three-class MLP and stops early:

```
$ twill run examples/classifier.tw
epoch  1/60  loss 1.0444  lr 0.002500  val_loss 0.9346  val_accuracy 0.5972
epoch  2/60  loss 0.6686  lr 0.005000  val_loss 0.5529  val_accuracy 0.8611
epoch  3/60  loss 0.3440  lr 0.007500  val_loss 0.3083  val_accuracy 0.9306
...
epoch 15/60  loss 0.0208  lr 0.009127  val_loss 0.1256  val_accuracy 0.9583
stopped: accuracy has not improved for 9 evaluations; best was 0.9583 at epoch 6
trained 15 epochs
best parameters are in runs/blobs.ckpt.best
parameters for selvedge are in runs/blobs.params
held-out accuracy 0.958333
```

The elided lines are a per-epoch progress bar and epochs 4 to 14. It writes
into `examples/runs/`, which it creates.

`docs/needs.md` is still worth reading -- it is the list of what this library
asked the language for, and it now records which of those arrived and which are
still open.

## The pipeline

loom is the first of three repositories and the other two consume what it
writes. There is no packaging step between them; the handoff is a file.

```bash
cd loom     && twill run examples/classifier.tw
cp loom/examples/runs/blobs.params selvedge/examples/runs/blobs.params
cd selvedge && twill run examples/publish.tw
cp selvedge/examples/models/blobs-1.2.0.slv shuttle/examples/models/blobs-1.2.0.slv
cd shuttle  && twill run examples/serve.tw
```

Each of the three examples also runs on its own, with a fixture it generates and
a printed line saying which part of the result is not real. The chain above is
what makes all three real at once.

## What loom is

The layer above `std/nn`. `std/nn` gives you layers, activations and losses;
`std/optim` gives you an update rule. Neither gives you an epoch, a metric that
survives a short final batch, a checkpoint you can resume from, or a place to
hang early stopping. That is loom.

Every row below names the test or the example that runs it. A row that names
nothing is a row that claims nothing.

| Piece | State |
| --- | --- |
| `fit` / `evaluate` / `predict`, with the step function passed in | runs. `tests/trainer_test.tw`, and `examples/classifier.tw` trains through it |
| Callbacks with a total, documented order and seven hook points | runs. `tests/callback_test.tw` asserts the band order and the reversal |
| Early stopping, checkpointing, LR schedules, metric logging, progress | runs. `tests/callback_test.tw`, and the example configures all five at once |
| Checkpoint and restore covering parameters, optimiser state and epoch | runs. `tests/checkpoint_test.tw`, and `a_resumed_run_equals_an_uninterrupted_one` in `tests/trainer_test.tw` |
| Batch-size-weighted metric accumulation | runs. `tests/metrics_test.tw`, and `the_epoch_loss_is_weighted_by_batch_size` |
| Reproducibility from one explicit seed, threaded, no hidden global | runs. `tests/rng_test.tw` pins the stream against a reference splitmix64 |
| Mixed precision: bf16 and f16 policies, f32 masters, dynamic loss scaling | runs under `tests/precision_test.tw`. No example uses it, and no run has been trained in it |
| Coloured output, and a progress bar | runs. `src/report.tw` calls `std/term`, and `tests/report_test.tw` covers the formatting |
| A time estimate on the progress bar | **not wired.** twill 1.7 has `mono_ns`; loom does not call it. See below |
| Distributed training, gradient accumulation | **not in v0.1.** Nothing here does either |
| Anything running end to end | runs. `twill run examples/classifier.tw`, output above |

## The loop is not hidden

loom does not own your update rule. `fit` takes a step function, and the step
function is the whole update: forward, loss, gradient, optimiser, new
parameters. loom owns the epoch, the batching, the metrics, the callbacks and
the checkpoint, and nothing else.

```rust
mode systems

import "twill_modules/loom/src/trainer.tw" as tr
import "twill_modules/loom/src/state.tw" as st
import "twill_modules/loom/src/data.tw" as dt
import "twill_modules/loom/src/metrics.tw" as met
import "twill_modules/loom/src/callback.tw" as cb

import "std/nn" as nn

fn logits(p: Tree, x: Tensor) -> Tensor {
  let h = relu(x @ transpose(p.w1) + p.b1)
  h @ transpose(p.w2) + p.b2
}

fn loss_fn(p: Tree, x: Tensor, y: Tensor) -> Tensor {
  tr.cross_entropy_batch(logits(p, x), y, 3)
}

# The step. Every gradient in the run passes through here, in your file.
fn step(p: Tree, opt: st.OptState, x: Tensor, y: Tensor, lr: F64) -> st.StepResult {
  tr.default_step(p, opt, x, y, lr, loss_fn)
}

# What a validation pass measures. Per-row means, so the trainer can weight
# them by the batch's row count.
fn eval_batch(p: Tree, x: Tensor, y: Tensor) -> met.MeterSet {
  let ms = met.new_meters()
  let out = logits(p, x)
  met.update_named(ms, "loss", item(tr.cross_entropy_batch(out, y, 3)), shape(x)[0])
  met.update_named(ms, "accuracy", met.accuracy(out, y), shape(x)[0])
  ms
}

let params = { w1: nn.he_init(16, 4), b1: zeros(16),
               w2: nn.he_init(3, 16),  b2: zeros(3) }

# epochs, batch size, learning rate, seed. The seed is not optional.
let cfg = st.config(60, 16, 0.01, 20260807)
let run = st.new_run(params, st.adam(params), cfg)

let cbs: Arr[cb.Callback] = [
  cb.cosine_lr(0.01, 0.0002, 60, 3),
  cb.early_stopping("accuracy", true, 8, 0.001),
  cb.checkpointing("runs/blobs.ckpt", 10, true, "accuracy", true),
  cb.metric_log(false),
  cb.progress(24, 0),
]

match tr.fit(run, cbs, train, val, step, eval_batch) {
  Ok(_) => unit,
  Err(msg) => print("loom: " + msg),
}

let pred = tr.predict(run.params, val.x, 64, logits)
```

Output, one line per epoch. This is the run above, not a sketch of one:

```
epoch  1/60  loss 1.0444  lr 0.002500  val_loss 0.9346  val_accuracy 0.5972
epoch  2/60  loss 0.6686  lr 0.005000  val_loss 0.5529  val_accuracy 0.8611
...
epoch 15/60  loss 0.0208  lr 0.009127  val_loss 0.1256  val_accuracy 0.9583
stopped: accuracy has not improved for 9 evaluations; best was 0.9583 at epoch 6
```

Sixty epochs were budgeted and fifteen were run, because on three well separated
blobs the accuracy reaches its ceiling in six and early stopping is doing its
job. `examples/classifier.tw` is the same program, complete.

## Callback ordering

Ambiguous callback ordering is a real source of silent bugs, so loom's is total
and it is written down. It is not the order you list them in.

**Hook points.** Seven, and no others.

| Hook | When |
| --- | --- |
| `HOOK_RUN_BEGIN` | once, before the first epoch, after any restore |
| `HOOK_EPOCH_BEGIN` | after the epoch seed is set and the row order drawn |
| `HOOK_BATCH_BEGIN` | before each optimiser step; `State.lr` set here is the rate the step uses |
| `HOOK_BATCH_END` | after each step; `train_loss` is the running epoch mean, not the batch loss |
| `HOOK_EVAL_END` | after a validation pass, only on epochs where one ran |
| `HOOK_EPOCH_END` | after the epoch and any evaluation; `State.epoch` already incremented |
| `HOOK_RUN_END` | once, however the run ended |

**Order.** Every callback carries a band. Within a hook, callbacks run by
ascending band, ties broken by position in your array. Begin hooks run in that
order; end hooks run in the reverse of it, so a callback that wraps another at
`BATCH_BEGIN` still wraps it at `BATCH_END`.

| Band | Callback | Why there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | schedules | writes `State.lr`, so everything after it sees the rate this epoch trains at |
| 20 | early stopping | writes `State.stop`, and owns "is this the best epoch" |
| 30 | checkpointing | asks early stopping that question, so it runs after it |
| 40 | metric logging | reads only; can name the file the checkpoint just wrote |
| 50 | progress | reads only, prints last |

**The rule that keeps it maintainable.** A callback that writes to `State` has a
lower band than every callback that reads what it wrote, and two callbacks never
write the same field. Both are checked by `cb.validate` at the start of the run,
not left to review: two schedules or two early stoppers in one run are refused
with a message rather than resolved by whichever happens to sort first.

**A consequence worth knowing.** A metric-monitoring callback lives on
`HOOK_EVAL_END`, not `HOOK_EPOCH_END`, because on `EPOCH_END` a validation
metric may be an epoch stale. It also means patience is counted in evaluations,
so with `eval_every = 2` a patience of 3 is six epochs.

## Metrics that survive a short final batch

The classic bug: collect one loss per batch, take their mean. That is an
unweighted mean of weighted means, and it is only correct when every batch is
the same size. With 1000 rows and a batch size of 256 the last batch holds 232
and gets the same say as each 256-row batch.

`src/metrics.tw` stores a weighted sum and the total weight, and the weight is
the batch's row count. That is the only thing that is correct.

It is also only correct for metrics that are themselves means over rows: loss,
accuracy, MAE. Precision, recall, F1 and AUC are not, and they get `Counter`,
which accumulates the counts and divides once at the end.

## Checkpoints that resume rather than restart

The test loom is written against: train 20 epochs; separately train 10,
checkpoint, restore, train 10 more. The two parameter trees must be equal.
`tests/trainer_test.tw` is that test.

**Captured:** parameters, optimiser moments, adam's step count `t`, the epoch,
the global step, the current learning rate, the base seed, and the callbacks'
patience counters and bests.

`t` is why a parameters-only checkpoint is wrong. Adam divides by `1 - b1^t`,
and restarting `t` at 1 multiplies the first resumed update by about ten. The
loss spike gets blamed on the data.

**Not captured:** the dataset (the row count is recorded and a mismatch is
refused), the model's shape, the generator's position within an epoch, and the
step function, which is a function value and not serialisable. A restore into a
different seed, batch size or optimiser kind is an error, not a warning.

Checkpoints are taken on epoch boundaries only. That is a consequence of how
reproducibility is done, below, and it is stated rather than worked around.

## One seed, threaded

Deterministic-by-default randomness makes a program reproduce. It does not make
a *resumed* run reproduce: the generator has a position as well as a seed, and a
run restarted at epoch 10 has a generator at position zero while the
uninterrupted run's is wherever ten epochs of shuffling left it. Every parameter
after that differs.

loom reseeds at the top of every epoch from a mix of the base seed and the epoch
index, so epoch 10 draws the same numbers whether it is the tenth epoch of a run
or the first after a resume. Nothing in loom reads a global seed, and nothing
outside `src/rng.tw` calls `seed`. Other stochastic decisions, a train/test split
or an initialisation, draw from a *derived* seed, so adding a validation split
does not shift the batch orders of a run that previously had none.

The cost: within an epoch the stream is still positional, which is why
checkpoints are on epoch boundaries.

## Mixed precision, and why bf16

twill's dtype design (`docs/dtypes.md` in the twill repository) gives training
three rules: the forward pass may run narrow, gradients are never narrower than
f32, and anything narrower than f32 accumulates in f32. `src/precision.tw`
turns those into a policy. Adopting one is one changed line in a step function
and one call on the initial parameters:

```rust
import "twill_modules/loom/src/precision.tw" as prec

let POLICY = prec.mixed_bf16()

fn step(p: Tree, opt: st.OptState, x: Tensor, y: Tensor, lr: F64) -> st.StepResult {
  prec.mixed_step(POLICY, p, opt, x, y, lr, loss_fn)
}

let params = prec.masters(init_model())
```

`masters` makes the parameters f32. `mixed_step` narrows them, and the batch,
to the policy's dtype for the forward pass, so the activations and the matmuls
that move the memory run narrow; twill's autodiff hands the gradients back at
f32, and the optimiser updates the f32 masters, which are what checkpoints
capture. The narrow weights are a rounded copy, remade every step. Evaluate
with the same policy: an `eval_batch` that runs the masters wide measures a
model the run is not training.

**Use `prec.mixed_bf16()`.** bf16 and f16 are the same sixteen bits spent
differently. bf16 keeps f32's exponent range and about three significant
digits, so every gradient representable in f32 is representable in bf16 and it
trains with no extra machinery. f16 carries about half a digit more precision
in a range that ends at 65504 and loses gradients below f16's smallest normal,
so it cannot train bare: a gradient that underflows to zero is a parameter
that stops learning and reports nothing.

`prec.mixed_f16()` therefore runs dynamic loss scaling: the loss is multiplied
by a scale before the backward pass, which by the chain rule multiplies every
gradient by the same factor and lifts it into representable range; the scale is
divided back out before the optimiser sees anything. When a gradient still
comes back non-finite the step is **skipped** and the scale halved; after 2000
clean steps the scale doubles, probing for the largest value the model
tolerates. The skip is the part that matters. Clipping an infinity to a large
finite number is a plausible-looking update in an arbitrary direction, and a
run built on it trains to a worse model while reporting nothing. A skipped
batch costs one batch, and `Policy.skipped` counts them.

So: f16's extra half digit rarely pays for the scaling machinery, and the
machinery is only as good as the run that remembers all of it. That is the
twill design's recommendation, and it is loom's.

Two limits, stated rather than discovered. Until twill's packed buffer lands
(NEEDS-111 there), a policy changes the arithmetic, exactly as a 16-bit run
would compute it, and saves no memory. And the loss-scale state is not
checkpointed: a resumed f16 run re-converges its scale rather than restoring
it, so it is not bit-identical to an uninterrupted run while the scales
differ. bf16 has no such window, which is one more reason it is the default.

## Colour, and the missing time estimate

Colour was the gap and is not one any more. twill's terminal layer is
`std/term/caps`, `std/term/ansi` and `std/term/theme`, which are ordinary `std/`
modules and therefore reachable from an installed package. `src/report.tw`
imports all three, detects the terminal's capabilities and lights the loss value
and the bar's fill, dropping to plain text the moment the output is piped.

What is still missing is the time estimate, and it is now missing because loom
has not written it rather than because twill cannot. twill 1.7 has `mono_ns`
and `clock_now_ms`; loom calls neither, so `bar` is a fill and a percentage
with no remaining-time figure. For a 400-epoch run the estimate is the useful
part of a progress bar, so this is the gap worth closing next.

The work is not the arithmetic. It is threading a time source through the
trainer so that a resumed run's estimate is not computed from a start time it
never had, which is a correctness surface of its own. `docs/needs.md` entry 16.
Duplicating a stateful bar from elsewhere in the ecosystem is still rejected for
the reason it always was: two progress bars drift, and the drift is visible to
users.

## Install

`mode systems` works. spool does not vendor loom for you yet, so until it does
the two ways in are a clone beside your project, or:

```
spool add loom https://github.com/twill-lang/loom
```

spool vendors into `twill_modules/`, and twill's import is a path, which is why
the import lines in the example above are the long ones. **A path in twill,
whether it is an import or an argument to `read_file` or `save`, resolves
against the directory of the file that contains it, not against the working
directory.** So the imports above are written from the file that does the
importing, and `twill run examples/classifier.tw` writes into `examples/runs/`
whatever directory you invoke it from. That is twill's rule rather than loom's;
see spool's README.

## Dependencies

twill, and nothing else. No third-party twill packages and no Go. `std/nn`,
`std/optim`, `std/data` and the tensor builtins are the whole surface loom
builds on.

## Contributing

The most useful contribution right now is not code. It is a correction to
[`docs/needs.md`](docs/needs.md): a feature listed there that the language
already has, a workaround that is worse than described, or a missing entry found
by reading the source. After that, the callback ordering table above is the part
most worth arguing with.
